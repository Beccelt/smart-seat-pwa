To launch this application: <br><br>
<li>
  <em>1)</em> Install Adobe's Brackets.io live browser app here: http://brackets.io/ <br>
  <em>2)</em> In Arduino, go to File -> Examples -> Firmata -> StandardFirmata.ino and run this on your Arduino. This is to enable crossbridging between the Arduino and Bluetooth clients. <br>
  <em>3)</em> On Brackets.io, go to Debug -> Open Preferences file. From there, go to the brackets.json file (the file to the right) and add the following line (add inside the brackete and include the following quotes): "livedev.multibrowser": true <br>
  <em>4)</em> Run the index.html file by making sure index.html is the file in focus, then click on the lightning icon on the right hand corner. <br>
  <em>5)</em> Copy the IP link from your default browser (if not already on Google Chrome), and paste it onto the Google Chrome browser bar. From there, you are able to right click on the browser and click on 'Inspect Element'
